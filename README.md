`Github ranking` is a submodule used to collect popular github repositories.

`application-list.csv` -- List all the application/repository candidates.

`MMR-list.csv ` -- List all the studied memory management routines, include source file path, call path length, argument usage, arguemnt data type, return value usage, return value type.

`MMR-Functionalities.xlsx` -- List all the studied memory managment routines' functionalities.

`Reliability` The `*.adapted` and `*.allErrors` files include the manually analysed applications. The python scripts were used to collect the commit history from the github repos.
